**Analysis of PM2.5 Pollutant Sources in Jakarta Using Deep Learning Models and Back Trajectory Approach**

PM2.5 concentrations in Jakarta consistently exceed WHO safety thresholds, necessitating an integrated scientific approach to predict pollution patterns and accurately identify their sources. This study aims to build a spatiotemporal prediction architecture based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) integrated with the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model for backward trajectory analysis. PM2.5 data were obtained from five monitoring stations in Jakarta with periode data Jan 2022 until Des 2024, combined with ERA5, Visualcrossing and Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) meteorological data, and spatially validated using Sentinel-2 land cover maps. Through hyperparameter tuning, the developed LSTM model demonstrated robust predictive performance with Coefficient of Determination (R2) values ranging from 65,55% to 75,87% on test data. The Jagakarsa and Lubang Buaya stations recorded the best relative accuracy with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 13,34% and 16,35%, respectively. Backward trajectory analysis triggered by extreme pollution episodes revealed two primary regional pollutant transport corridors: (1) the East-Southeast corridor carrying emissions from the Karawang-Bekasi industrial zones and North Coast power plants, and (2) the North-Northwest corridor transmitting pollutants from Banten industrial areas and Sumatra. Land cover data integration confirmed that air mass trajectories traversed dense industrial built-up areas. This study concludes that extreme pollution events in Jakarta result from the superposition of local emissions and transboundary pollutant transport, exacerbated by meteorological subsidence phenomena that trap pollutants at the surface layer.
